# angularjs-requirejs-style-guide

This is a sample project to demonstrate how to use angularjs with requirejs along with [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router).
Why I made this? I mentioned here in my blog: http://blog.rishabhmhjn.me/post/140561137554/using-angularjs-with-requirejs-grunt-and

*Sample contains some parts of code from the sample available at [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router).*


## TODO

- optimize grunt distribution task using r.js

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
